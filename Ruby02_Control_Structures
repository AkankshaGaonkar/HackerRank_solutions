## Control Structures


## Ruby Control Structures - Each
# use control structure each to iterate through its collections
# given a method called scoring with an array passed as an argument. Elements of the array are of the class User.
# User class has a method update_score
# task is to iterate through each of the elements in the array using each and call the method update_score on every element

# Option 1
def scoring(array)
    # iterate through each of the element in array using *each* and call update_score on it
    array.each do |user|
        user.update_score
    end
end

# Option 2
def scoring(array)
    # iterate through each of the element in array using *each* and call update_score on it
    array.each { 
        |user|
        user.update_score
        }
end
